## MasterClass Discount — Do They Offer Any?

Well, here’s where things get interesting. MasterClass itself **doesn’t offer public discount coupons or promo codes** — and beware of sites claiming they do, because they’re usually not legit. However, they do have official sales and deals that you can access directly on their site.

For teams, MasterClass runs a **“MasterClass for Businesses” program**, which offers 5–35% off for teams of 5 to 20 people. This is perfect for companies looking to boost employee skills or as a creative team gift. If you’ve got more than 20 people interested, the sales team can offer custom discounts and additional perks — so it’s worth reaching out to them.
